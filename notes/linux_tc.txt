# Handle "1:" is equivalent to <major>:<minor>... minor of qdisc is always 0.
#   This is the "root" qdisc with a handle of 1:
# Classes need to have the same major number as their parent.
#   The following command instantly creates classes 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3.

#tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: prio


# 1:3 refers to the third band of the PRIO queue.
# This described by qdisc ID of 30:

#tc class add dev lo parent 1:3 classid 1:10 netem delay 200ms 20ms distribution normal    # Delayed 200
#tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:3 classid 1:20 netem loss 1%                                 # Dropped 1%
# 20% of packets sent immediately, rest delayed 10ms
#tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:3 classid 1:30 netem delay 10ms reorder 25% 50%              # out-of-order
#tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:3 classid 1:30 netem delay 10ms duplicate 10%                # duplicate 10%
#tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:3 classid 1:40 netem corrupt 1%                              # corrupt 1%


# What packets belong in what qdisc?
#
# protocol ip   -- We are accepting IP traffic
# parent        -- Must already exist (1:0 as specified above)
# prio          -- Priority of this filter is set to 3. Lower the quicker.
# fw flowid     -- Bases the decision on how the firewall (iptables) marked the packet, to be processed by the 1:3 class
# handle        -- filter ID

#tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:0 protocol ip prio 3 handle 1 fw flowid 1:3

# -o is for outbound; -i is for inbound
# Mangle (modify) packets before they leave (POSTROUTING) on eth0 udp traffic.
# Applied to class 1:3 <parent>:<child>

#iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -p udp -j CLASSIFY --set-class 1:3

# So all in all, IP tables marks that all UDP packets sent out are processed by '1:3' which enacts on the IP protocol,
# adding a delay of 200ms to each UDP packet.

# Goal will be to set up a few netem filters and use IP tables to control which one is in use.
#   1. Outgoing packet delay
#   2. Dropping outgoing packets
#   3. Re-ordering packets
#   4. Packet duplication
#   5. Packet corruption
#   6. Enable ALL in some fashion (dying connection)
